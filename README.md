# Elfproef

An implementation of the Elfproef test using Clojure, to show how powerful and easy functional programming can be.

## Usage

To use this function import/download the source or copy the function. And use the function by passing an input string of numbers as first argument and a vector with weights of each number in the input as second argument. An exmaple:

    (elfproef "736160221" [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1])

The function will return true if it is a valid input based on the input, and false if not.

## Examples

`(elfproef "736160221" [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) ;; valid => true`

`(elfproef "0000000" [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) ;; invalid => false`
